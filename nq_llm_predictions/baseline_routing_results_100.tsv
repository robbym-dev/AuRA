Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type–based printing press system.

why does kerosene oil rise up in the wick of lantern	['A kerosene lamp (also known as a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene as a fuel. The practical kerosene-fueled lamp was invented by the Polish pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz in Lviv in 1853, as significant improvement over lamps designed to burn vegetable or sperm oil. Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting. Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.\n']	Kerosene oil rises up in the wick of a lantern due to a process known as capillary action. Capillary action occurs when the adhesion of the liquid molecules to the surface of the wick is stronger than the cohesion among the liquid molecules themselves. This adhesion pulls the kerosene up through the narrow spaces in the wick material, allowing it to reach the flame where it can be used as fuel to produce light.
when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils	"['As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called ""plumbago"" (Latin for ""lead ore""). Because the pencil core is still referred to as ""lead"", or a ""lead"", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, and the black core of pencils is still referred to as ""lead"", even though it never contained the element lead. The words for pencil in German (""bleistift""), Irish (""peann luaidhe""), Arabic (قلم رصاص ""qalam raṣāṣ""), and some other languages literally mean ""lead pen"".\n']"	Graphite began to replace other materials in pencils in 1565 after the discovery of a large deposit of extremely pure and solid graphite in Cumbria, England. This solid form of graphite could be easily sawn into sticks, which facilitated its use as a core in pencils. Prior to this, the closest predecessor for marking material was silverpoint.

Then finding whatever new and original beats and moments come out of that by working with the director and living the life of the character organically in the moment. As it’s scripted, this is what the character does - not me. That’s how I separate myself from that. I don’t use the Method.
