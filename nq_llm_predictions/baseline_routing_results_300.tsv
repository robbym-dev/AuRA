who invented the printing press and what year	"[""Johannes Gutenberg, a goldsmith by profession, developed, circa 1439, a printing system by adapting existing technologies to printing purposes, as well as making inventions of his own. Printing in East Asia had been prevalent since the Tang dynasty, and in Europe, woodblock printing based on existing screw presses was common by the 14th century. Gutenberg's most important innovation was the development of hand-molded metal printing matrices, thus producing a movable type–based printing press system. His newly devised hand mould made possible the precise and rapid creation of metal movable type in large quantities. Movable type had been hitherto unknown in Europe.

why does kerosene oil rise up in the wick of lantern	['A kerosene lamp (also known as a paraffin lamp in some countries) is a type of lighting device that uses kerosene as a fuel. The practical kerosene-fueled lamp was invented by the Polish pharmacist Ignacy Łukasiewicz in Lviv in 1853, as significant improvement over lamps designed to burn vegetable or sperm oil. Kerosene lamps have a wick or mantle as light source, protected by a glass chimney or globe; lamps may be used on a table, or hand-held lanterns may be used for portable lighting. Like oil lamps, they are useful for lighting without electricity, such as in regions without rural electrification, in electrified areas during power outages, at campsites, and on boats. There are three types of kerosene lamp: flat-wick, central-draught (tubular round wick), and mantle lamp. Kerosene lanterns meant for portable use have a flat wick and are made in dead-flame, hot-blast, and cold-blast variants.\n']	Kerosene oil rises up in the wick of a lantern due to the action of capillary action. This is a physical process where liquid moves up a porous material, such as the wick, against gravity. The cohesion between liquid molecules and adhesion between the liquid and the material of the wick facilitate this upward movement, enabling the kerosene to reach the flame where it can be burnt to produce light.
when did they replace lead with graphite in pencils	"['As a technique for drawing, the closest predecessor to the pencil was silverpoint until in 1565 (some sources say as early as 1500), a large deposit of graphite was discovered on the approach to Grey Knotts from the hamlet of Seathwaite in Borrowdale parish, Cumbria, England. This particular deposit of graphite was extremely pure and solid, and it could easily be sawn into sticks. It remains the only large-scale deposit of graphite ever found in this solid form. Chemistry was in its infancy and the substance was thought to be a form of lead. Consequently, it was called ""plumbago"" (Latin for ""lead ore""). Because the pencil core is still referred to as ""lead"", or a ""lead"", many people have the misconception that the graphite in the pencil is lead, and the black core of pencils is still referred to as ""lead"", even though it never contained the element lead. The words for pencil in German (""bleistift""), Irish (""peann luaidhe""), Arabic (قلم رصاص ""qalam raṣāṣ""), and some other languages literally mean ""lead pen"".\n']"	Graphite began to replace lead (which was never actually lead but thought to be so) in pencils around 1565, after a large deposit of graphite was discovered in Cumbria, England. This pure and solid graphite was easily made into sticks, marking the transition from using lead-like materials to graphite in pencils.

name two fibres which are made of proteins	"[""The organ consists of a minute skin papilla with 0.1–0.2\xa0mm diameter. At the papilla's core, a geometric constellation of nerve fibres with free endings is embedded symmetrically in a column of epithelial cells. Eimer saw two to three single nerve fibres, rising straight in the middle of the column and ending in the fifth layer under the stratum corneum that forms the hard top of the epidermis. The fibres extend short protrusions perpendicularly into each epithelial layer they traverse, where the protrusions end in 'buttons'. They are ringed by a circle of roughly 19 evenly spaced nerve fibres, known as satellite fibres, whose protrusions point inwards. In addition, Eimer distinguished a separate set of nerve fibres with free nerve endings. By contrast to the fibres in the papilla's core, these travel obliquely toward the surface at the papilla's perimeter.\n""]"	The document provided does not discuss fibres made of proteins. It mainly describes the structure and arrangement of nerve fibres in a skin papilla. Therefore, I am unable to name two fibres made of proteins based on the information in this document.
